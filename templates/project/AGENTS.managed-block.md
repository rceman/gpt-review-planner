> Operating model:
> - GPT owns architecture, behavior contracts, fixtures, tests, static/artifact review, and the principal implementation. GPT does not execute runtime quality gates.
> - The local agent owns integration, dependency restoration, formatting, compilation, linting, runtime tests, benchmarks, evidence, and minimal integration corrections.
> - The local agent must not redesign approved behavior or weaken tests and acceptance criteria.
> - GPT reviews agent-reported runtime evidence without rerunning tests.
